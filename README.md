- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @onronal
- I work as a backend-focused full stack developer using .Net Core and Angular. I earned my first income in software during my student years with PHP and later founded a coding academy for children after graduation. Before corporate life, I joined an IoT project at Y3T Systems as an external contributor. I easily adapt to different disciplines. Since high school, I have been involved in civil society, managing two youth organizations and improving my public speaking and representation skills.
